This homework will work like uniq but search recursively through directories and count words not lines

Program will search recursively into levels of directories and count words in each file and send the result to main process
Main process will write a log file for count of each word in files.
Main process will print count of unique words.
If there is a non-character in word such as numbers, spelling marks etc. word will not count but spelling marks at end of the word is eligible to count

Prints example output is:
There are x unique word in <directoryName>
There are x subdirectory and x files under <directoryName>

Log file example:
"word" <count>
"word" <count>

usage:
wordCount -directoryName
