This homework will work like wc(word count) but lesser feature

Program will search recursively into levels of directories and count words in each file and print result individually
If there is a non-character in word such as numbers, spelling marks etc. word will not count but spelling marks at end of the word is eligible to count
Prints example output is:
PID countResult "relative path to execution"

usage:
wordCount -directoryName
