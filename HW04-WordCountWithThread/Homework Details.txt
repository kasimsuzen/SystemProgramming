This homework have same conditions as Homework 2 but this will use thread instead of processes

Program will search recursively into levels of directories and count words in each file and print result individually.
For each directory and file a thread will create and that thread will do the counting
If there is a non-character in word such as numbers, spelling marks etc. word will not count but spelling marks at end of the word is eligible to count
Prints example output is:
ThreadID countResult "relative path to execution"

usage:
wordCount -directoryName
